			<h2>Background</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="project-desc-right">
			<div class="project-desc-section">
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>Vitech broadly serves three industrial verticals - Insurance, Investments, and Retirement. Fund Analytics Manager is built for the investments vertical giving fund managers the power to manage the full life cycle of the fund, from fund creation to portfolio management, to investor allocations and communications. Fund capital transactions, fees and expenses, as well as investment gain/loss can be allocated through to build out each investor’s capital account, which allows for immediate access to an investor’s position.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-desc-section">
				<h3>Introduction to the Platform</h3>
				<p>Vitech's next-generation React platform is a robust framework that serves as a base for all our new self-service apps. We use React Material under the hood that is modified to serve Vitech's Design System components.</p>

				<h3>Objectives</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>To identify and prioritize use cases to validate the opportunities for the team to focus on.</li>
					<li>To learn about business requirements, user needs, and technology capabilities/constraints.</li>
					<li>Conducting competitive research, gathering inspiration, and exploring a visual design that sets up our customers for success.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="project-desc-section">
				<h3>Supporting Data</h3>
				<p>A rudimentary version of what we set out to build existed in our Core Admin platform for many years. We spoke to a few customers and SMEs regarding this and found a lot of scope for improvement while building a new application. They have, at times, shown to be leading indicators for market needs. To note specific examples:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Classifying and displaying funds has always been a challenging task. A given portfolio might have a mix of different kinds of funds, and a portfolio would often contain hundreds of funds.</li>
					<li>While running calculations on funds, we have had users reporting difficulties with the UX as the fields required to perform a calculation would change from one type of calculation to another.</li>
					<li>We had a demo request for the new platform from Bridgewater Associates, one of our largest clients.</li>
					<li>As we have been rolling out a lot of self-service applications based on the next-gen React platform, it seemed appropriate to build one for investors and fund managers.</li>
					<li>Fund managers often share portfolio data with their clients, partners, employees, and other stakeholders. We wanted to build a tool that would make this sharing of data simple and robust.</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Measures of Success</h3>
				<p>We will consider the product to be a success when:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Fund managers are able to create their portfolios and perform calculations like Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Fund IRR, Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWR), Return Over Time (ROT), etc. We will only focus on the four types of aforementioned calc types.</li>
					<li>Our existing customers switching from the Core Admin tool to the new Fund Analytics Manager. This would imply a base-level success as our users would be using the same product to perform the tasks that they have done using our older product.</li>
					<li>Some more metrics need to be further refined for early adopters and for when the product is generally available for all customers. This application will be offered as a standalone solution to new customers who aren't familiar with our current Core Admin tool.</li>
					<li>We've gotten positive feedback from user interviews confirming that our solution is at par or better than other tools they have used for the same function. This will be conducted with Bridgewater Associates.</li>
